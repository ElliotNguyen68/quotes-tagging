Yes, these events cause grief and sadness, but grief and sadness pass, like everything else, and are replaced with other experiences. The ego, however, clings to negative thoughts and feelings and, as a result, magnifies, intensifies, and sustains those emotions while the ego overlooks the subtle feelings of joy, gratitude, excitement, adventure, love, and peace that come from Essence.

Until now both lies and truth have taken recourse to ethics. But only lies have profited because they were able to appear under the guise of truth.

Human beings cannot conceive of any means of survival except of a single then-and-there contest.
