Possessing \u2018ego vision\u2019, a person\u2019s view through her/his physical eyes is quite versatile; able to discern wide and varied vistas over huge distances or scrutinizing the minutest of details.Ego\u2019s very nature: capable of relatively expansive, detailed, and yet individualistic perspective is crucial. Separating itself out from the God Force, ego extracts infinite unique experiences, integral to humanity\u2019s process of spiritualizing matter. Incarnating on the earth, achieving individualism is therefore critical for attainment of divinity.Individualism may cause momentary estrangement from the God Self. However, this person has forgotten that they are everything in the mirror, the \u2018sliver\u2019 and the \u2018ball of light\u2019,\u201d continues Kuan Yin.During this complex passage Lena was inundated by infinite rapid-fire visuals: emanations from the God Mind.\u201cFurther and unfortunately, wrong assumptions are made about suffering. Some individuals even believe that it is required, that suffering brings one closer to salvation. Quite the contrary,\u201d disputes Kuan Yin, \u201cthe God Force likes to play. Therefore, if all individuals could unite creating a real sense of community many problems could be healed.The God Force is separate and not separate, whole and not whole at the same time. Really, it is not \u2018sliceable\u2019, not reducible. Even when it is sliced into individual energies, it does not diminish the total God Force or the power of the individual.Each of you has the potential for the God Force potency. However, no individual can overcome the God Force. There is a misinterpretation, (by some) that Satan is as powerful as God. Limited energy cannot live on its own. Every experience must exist and yet they (the limiting forces) can never exist on their own. Limited energy, then, is the experience of the absence of the God Force. Therefore, there is no need to fear it.Those choosing such experiences have a need to understand how it feels to believe evil powers exist. Again, I say those who pursue this route are taking it too personally. They believe the story they\u2019ve made up about themselves.It is similar to a person going into an ice cream store and only choosing one flavor from many. Preoccupied with tasting that flavor for a very long time, they are probably quite sick and tired of it. Still, they don\u2019t want to believe there are any other flavors available. The \u2018agreement\u2019, then, is to continue to believe in that particular flavor. Here\u2019s where reincarnation and its opportunity for experiencing a vast array of perspectives, \u201cagreements\u201d, enters in. Another life offers another opportunity, a chance to \u2018switch flavors\u2019 so to speak.Taking oneself too personally, however, can cause a soul to get caught up, stuck in redundancy: in a particular (and perhaps unfortunate) flavor. In such instances, the individual is forgetting one has the ability to choose his or her flavors, lives,\u201d contends Kuan Yin.", "owner": "Hope Bradford, Oracle of Compassion: The Living Word of Kuan Yin"}, {"item": "Forgiveness is\u2026an archaic perception of personal debt and guilt designed by the ego to trap us unendingly within itself.", "owner": "Peter Santos, Everything I Wanted To Know About Spirituality But Didn't Know How To Ask: A Spiritual Seekers Guidebook"}, {"item": "...frankly, many times, the people that we resent either have no idea about it or could care less.", "owner": "Taite Adams, E-Go: Ego Distancing Through Mindfulness, Emotional Intelligence, and the Language of Love"}, {"item": "A life lived mired in resentment is one that is lived primarily in the past and this is never one that is filled with joy.", "owner": "Taite Adams"}, {"item": "Ego doesn't want us to be loving, forgiving and kind to each other or even to ourselves.", "owner": "Taite Adams, E-Go: Ego Distancing Through Mindfulness, Emotional Intelligence, and the Language of Love"}, {"item": "There is, inside all our heads, the ego\u2019s rabid attack dog.

As the ocean \"waves,\" the universe \"peoples.\" Every individual is an expression of the whole realm of nature, a unique action of the total universe.
