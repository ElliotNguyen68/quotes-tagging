That theory has been endorsed by dozens of prominent experts, has inspired school programs designed to get kids to feel better about themselves, and in the late 1980s led the California legislature to form a Task Force to Promote Self-Esteem. Yet Baumeister has shown that the theory could not be more spectacularly, hilariously, achingly wrong. Violence is a problem not of too little self-esteem but of too much, particularly when it is unearned.", "owner": "Steven Pinker, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined"}, {"item": "Once Ed said to me, \"For a very long time I didn't like myself.\" It was not said in self-pity but simply as an unfortunate fact. \"It was a very difficult time,\" he said, \"and very painful. I did not like myself for a number of reasons, some of them valid and some of them pure fancy. I would hate to have to go back to that. Then gradually,\" he said, \"I discovered with surprise and pleasure that a number of people did like me. And I thought, if they can like me, why cannot I like myself? Just thinking it did not do it, but slowly I learned to like myself and then it was all right.\" This was not said in self-love in its bad connotation but in self-knowledge. He meant literally that he had learned to accept and like the person \"Ed\" as he liked other people. It gave him a great advantage. Most people do not like themselves at all. They distrust themselves, put on masks and pomposities. They quarrel and boast and pretend and are jealous because they do not like themselves. But mostly they do not even know themselves well enough to form a true liking. They cannot see themselves well enough to form a true liking, and since we automatically fear and dislike strangers, we fear and dislike our stranger-selves.", "owner": "John Steinbeck, The Log from the Sea of Cortez"}, {"item": "That nice feeling when you look in the mirror, and your hair's right for the first time in your life?
