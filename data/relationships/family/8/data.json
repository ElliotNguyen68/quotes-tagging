In the first, agrarian stage, a father trained and disciplined his son for employment, and often offered him work on the farm, while his wife brought up the girls. (For blacks, this stage began after slavery ended.) As economic life and vocational training moved out of the family in the early nineteenth century, fathers left more of the child-rearing to their wives. According to the historian John Nash, in both these stages, fathers were often distant and stern. Not until the early twentieth century, when increasing numbers of women developed identities, beyond brief jobs before marriage, in the schoolhouse, factory, and office, did the culture discover the idea that \"father was friendly\". In the early 1950s, popular magazines began to offer articles with titles such as \"Fathers Are Parents Too\" and \"It's Time Father Got Back into the Family\". Today, we are in the third stage of economic development but the second stage of fatherhood.", "owner": "Arlie Russell Hochschild, The Second Shift"}, {"item": "When sisters stand shoulder to shoulder, who stands a chance against us?", "owner": "Pam Brown"}, {"item": "Headship is the divine calling of a husband to take primary responsibility for Christ-like, servant leadership, protection, and provision in the home.", "owner": "John Piper, This Momentary Marriage: A Parable of Permanence"}, {"item": "Show me a family of readers, and I will show you the people who move the world.", "owner": "Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte"}, {"item": "\u2026the traditional family structure that More supported in her writings enabled women to 'be intelligent, rational, virtuous, and noble creatures, capable of great intellectual and moral achievements.
