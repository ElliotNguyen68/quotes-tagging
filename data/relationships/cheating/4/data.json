How on earth could that explain any of this? Why would seeing someone else necessitate bringing home a middle\u00ad-aged woman, a teenaged punk and an American with a leather jacket and a Rod Stewart haircut? What would the story have been? But then, after reflection, I realised that Penny had probably been here before, and therefore knew that infidelity can usually provide the answer to any domestic mystery. If I had walked in with Sheena Easton and Donald Rumsfeld, Penny would probably have scratched her head for a few seconds before saying exactly the same thing. In other circumstances, on other evenings, it would have been the right conclusion, too; I used to be pretty resourceful when I was being unfaithful to Cindy, even if I do say so myself. I once drove a new BMW into a wall, simply because I needed to explain a four\u00ad-hour delay in getting home from work. Cindy came out into the street to inspect the crumpled bonnet, looked at me, and said, \u201cYou\u2019re seeing someone else, aren\u2019t you?\u201d I denied it, of course. But then, anything \u2013 smashing up a new car, persuading Donald Rumsfeld to come to an Islington flat in the early hours of New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 is easier than actually telling the truth.
