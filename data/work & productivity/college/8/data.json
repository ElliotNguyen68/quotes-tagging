It can be a period of maturation and of self-exploration, with an honest assessment of skills and interests, development of task organization and discipline, renewed intrafamily communication, and travel to interesting cities and small college towns.

The two of them watched hungrily as he sipped his milk. \"Feed and water the livestock, slop the pigs in the morning,\" Foote said rapidly.Stoner looked at him blankly. \"What?\"\"That's what you do in the morning,\" Foote said, \"before you leave for your school.
