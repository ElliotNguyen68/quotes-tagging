If other people are not having money problems, it pisses you off because it reminds you that you\u2019re limited in the ways you can express your agency in the world, and they aren\u2019t. Worrying about money is anger-inducing because it makes you think about time: how many dollars per hour, how much salary per year, how many years until retirement. Worrying about money forces you to do endless math in your head, and most people didn\u2019t like math in high school and they don\u2019t like it now.", "owner": "Douglas Coupland, Bit Rot"}, {"item": "The man who is receiving the money is getting rich and the guy who is giving the money is getting poorer", "owner": "Sunday Adelaja"}, {"item": "So I got to thinking that perhaps that\u2019s what money is: a crystallization\u2014or, rather, a homogenization\u2014of time and free will into those things we call dollars and pounds and yen and euros.
