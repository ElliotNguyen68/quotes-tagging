True love is not signaled by romantic, candle light dinners, red roses glistening with dew, or even Valentine's day celebrations. While these things may accompany our feelings, love is truly more than all those! Love is being with your spouse even when its not pleasing. Sometimes, love is walking down the hall, with your spouse hanging onto your shoulders and walking at a turtle's pace down the hall, just because surgery made life a burden. Love is patient, love is kind, love is Jesus! May we always remember love is not always tied in bows!\ufeff", "owner": "Mary Kate"}, {"item": "The human ego is the ugliest part of man. We lift up men who only show us darkness, and put down those brave enough to show us the light. Likewise, people engage in darkness when it is light outside, and acknowledge the light only when it is dark. We abandon those fighting for us to cheer behind those fighting against us. And, we only remember good people and God when it is convenient for us, and take them for granted because their doors are always open - only to chase after closed doors and personalities void of substance and truth.", "owner": "Suzy Kassem, Rise Up and Salute the Sun: The Writings of Suzy Kassem"}, {"item": "Anya looked upon Nin admirably.

And I don\u2019t know if he wrote it or not, but the headline in Corriere della Sera when it was published was \"S\u00ec, abbiamo un'anima. Ma \u00e8 fatta di tanti piccoli robot \u2013 \"Yes, we have a soul, but it\u2019s made of lots of tiny robots.\" And I thought, exactly. That\u2019s the view. Yes, we have a soul, but in what sense? In the sense that our brains, unlike the brains even of dogs and cats and chimpanzees and dolphins, our brains have functional structures that give our brains powers that no other brains have - powers of look-ahead, primarily. We can understand our position in the world, we can see the future, we can understand where we came from. We know that we\u2019re here. No buffalo knows it\u2019s a buffalo, but we jolly well know that we\u2019re members of Homo sapiens, and it\u2019s the knowledge that we have and the can-do, our capacity to think ahead and to reflect and to evaluate and to evaluate our evaluations, and evaluate the grounds for our evaluations.It\u2019s this expandable capacity to represent reasons that we have that gives us a soul. But what\u2019s it made of? It\u2019s made of neurons. It\u2019s made of lots of tiny robots.
