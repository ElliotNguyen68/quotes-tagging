Waiting to become something else, waiting to be that person I always thought I was on the verge of becoming, waiting for that life I thought I would have. In my head, I was always one step away. In high school, I was biding my time until I could become the college version of myself, the one my mind could see so clearly. In college, the post-college \u201cadult\u201d person was always looming in front of me, smarter, stronger, more organized. Then the married person, then the person I\u2019d become when we have kids. For twenty years, literally, I have waited to become the thin version of myself, because that\u2019s when life will really begin.And through all that waiting, here I am. My life is passing, day by day, and I am waiting for it to start. I am waiting for that time, that person, that event when my life will finally begin.I love movies about \u201cThe Big Moment\u201d \u2013 the game or the performance or the wedding day or the record deal, the stories that split time with that key event, and everything is reframed, before it and after it, because it has changed everything. I have always wanted this movie-worthy event, something that will change everything and grab me out of this waiting game into the whirlwind in front of me. I cry and cry at these movies, because I am still waiting for my own big moment. I had visions of life as an adventure, a thing to be celebrated and experienced, but all I was doing was going to work and coming home, and that wasn\u2019t what it looked like in the movies.John Lennon once said, \u201cLife is what happens when you\u2019re busy making other plans.\u201d For me, life is what was happening while I was busy waiting for my big moment. I was ready for it and believed that the rest of my life would fade into the background, and that my big moment would carry me through life like a lifeboat.The Big Moment, unfortunately, is an urban myth. Some people have them, in a sense, when they win the Heisman or become the next American Idol. But even that football player or that singer is living a life made up of more than that one moment. Life is a collection of a million, billion moments, tiny little moments and choices, like a handful of luminous, glowing pearl. It takes so much time, and so much work, and those beads and moments are so small, and so much less fabulous and dramatic than the movies.But this is what I\u2019m finding, in glimpses and flashes: this is it. This is it, in the best possible way. That thing I\u2019m waiting for, that adventure, that move-score-worthy experience unfolding gracefully. This is it. Normal, daily life ticking by on our streets and sidewalks, in our houses and apartments, in our beds and at our dinner tables, in our dreams and prayers and fights and secrets \u2013 this pedestrian life is the most precious thing any of use will ever experience.", "owner": "Shauna Niequist, Cold Tangerines: Celebrating the Extraordinary Nature of Everyday Life"}, {"item": "Prime numbers are what is left when you have taken all the patterns away.
