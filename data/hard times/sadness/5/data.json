But sadness is real because once it meant something real. It meant dignified, grave; it meant trustworthy; it meant exceptionally bad, deplorable, shameful; it meant massive, weighty, forming a compact body; it meant falling heavily; and it meant of a color: dark. It meant dark in color, to darken. It meant me. I felt sad.", "owner": "Claudia Rankine, Don\u2019t Let Me Be Lonely: An American Lyric"}, {"item": "I believe that almost all our sadnesses are moments of tension that we find paralyzing because we no longer hear our surprised feelings living. Because we are alone with the alien thing that has entered into our self; because everything intimate and accustomed is for an instant taken away; because we stand in the middle of a transition where we cannot remain standing. For this reason the sadness too passes: the new thing in us, the added thing, has entered into our heart, has gone into its inmost chamber and is not even there any more, \u2014 is already in our blood. And we do not learn what it was. We could easily be made to believe that nothing has happened, and yet we have changed, as a house changes into which a guest has entered.", "owner": "Rainer Maria Rilke"}, {"item": "Great sadnesses \u2026 they are the moments when something new has entered into us, something unknown; our feelings grow mute in shy perplexity, everything in us withdraws, a stillness comes, and the new, which no one knows, stands in the midst of it and is silent.", "owner": "Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet"}, {"item": "I have learned that when sadness comes to visit me, all I can do is say \u201cI see you.\u201d I spend some time with it, get up, and say goodbye.I don\u2019t push it away, I own it.

If you are stricken with a great sadness, you may feel as if you have been set aflame, not only because of the enormous pain, but also because your sadness may spread over your life, like smoke from an enormous fire. You might find it difficult to see anything but your own sadness, the way smoke can cover a landscape so that all anyone can see is black. You may find that happy things are tainted with sadness, the way smoke leaves its ashen colors and scents on everything it touches. And you may find that if someone pours water all over you, you are damp and distracted, but not cured of your sadness, the way a fire department can douse a fire but never recover what has been burnt down.", "owner": "Lemony Snicket, The Grim Grotto"}, {"item": "The tears come to my eyes so fast, there's just no way to stop them.", "owner": "Jonathan Tropper, How to Talk to a Widower"}], "pagination": {"size": 20, "total": 9, "current": 5}}
