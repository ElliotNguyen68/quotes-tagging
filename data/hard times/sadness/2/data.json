But often I did - with time I learned where to look - and tried to fit them together. It pained me that she felt she couldn't come to me with it, but I knew it would hurt her more to know that I'd uncovered what she hadn't intended for me to find.

And there\u2019s a sort of comfort in that, like being home after a trip or sleeping in your own bed after being away. There\u2019s just a sense that this is where I belong.
